ESPANJAPELI ARCHITECTURE NOTES
==============================

SSR & Story Loading
-------------------
Stories use environment-aware loading: SSR/prerender uses direct JSON imports to avoid Node.js fetch() limitations with relative paths, 
while browser runtime uses the lazy-loading service with caching. All story pages are prerendered at build time for performance and SEO.
