DISTRACTOR IMAGES TO GENERATE (45 total)
================================================================================

WORKFLOW:
1. Read svg_todo.txt to see the list of 45 distractor images
2. For each distractor image, generate a detailed visual idea following the format above
3. UPDATE svg_todo.txt by adding the detailed idea AFTER each numbered item
4. Keep the original numbered list intact, just add the detailed description below each item

EXAMPLE OF HOW TO UPDATE svg_todo.txt:

BEFORE:
```
1. angry - Angry
```

AFTER:
```
1. angry - Angry
- [ ] image done into file angry.svg

- BACKGROUND:
    Simple indoor setting with a soft gradient background transitioning from light blue (#E0F4FF) 
    at the top to warm cream (#FFF8E7) at the bottom. The floor is suggested by a simple tan line. 
    No distracting elements - the focus is entirely on the character and their emotion. Soft, 
    diffused lighting from above creates a neutral but slightly warm atmosphere.

- MAIN CHARACTER(S):
    Peppa Pig stands dead center in the image, taking up about 60% of the vertical space. She 
    wears her signature red dress (#E63946). Her pink head (#F9C6CF) is tilted slightly down. 
    Her eyebrows are furrowed sharply downward in a V-shape, eyes narrowed with determination. 
    Her mouth is a firm, tight pout turned downward at the corners. Her arms are crossed tightly 
    over her chest, hooves gripping her upper arms. Her stance is wide and planted firmly, 
    showing she won't budge. Her cheeks have a slightly deeper pink tint (#FF8FAB) to show 
    the flush of frustration.

- ACTION & PROPS:
    The main action is Peppa displaying anger through her body language - no movement, just a 
    strong static pose of frustration. No props are needed as the focus is entirely on the 
    emotion. Her crossed arms and planted stance tell the whole story. The simplicity makes 
    the emotion instantly readable.

- MOOD & ATMOSPHERE:
    Frustrated and stubborn, but still completely kid-safe and not scary. This is the kind of 
    anger a 4-year-old shows when they don't get their way - pouty and determined rather than 
    threatening. The warm background softens the emotion while still making it clear Peppa is 
    not happy about something.
