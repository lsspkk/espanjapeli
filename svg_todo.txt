SVG REDRAWING TODO LIST
Peppa Pig Advanced Spanish Learning Materials
================================================================================

ROLE: You are an expert SVG vector drawing artist with extensive experience in:
- Comic book illustration and sequential art
- Children's picture books and educational materials
- Character animation for TV shows and web series
- The Peppa Pig visual style and aesthetic

YOUR TASK: Replace the contents of each duplicate SVG file below with unique, 
contextually appropriate illustrations based on the drawing ideas provided. 
Each image must clearly represent its Spanish phrase while maintaining the 
playful, child-friendly Peppa Pig aesthetic.

DRAWING GUIDELINES (written for an AI illustrator):
--------------------------------------
Your job is to create **one cheerful picturebook-style scene per phrase** in a clear Peppa Pig–like aesthetic. Aim for warmth, humor, and instant readability.

ART STYLE (the “Peppa” feel)
- Use **simple, confident lines** and **rounded, friendly shapes**.
- Keep details **minimal but meaningful** (choose a few iconic props rather than many tiny ones).
- Characters should have **consistent, recognizable proportions** (big simple head, small body, tiny limbs).
- Expressions must be **kind, safe, and kid-friendly** (no scary faces, no harsh drama).

COMPOSITION RECIPE (do this every time)
- Make the **main action obvious in 1 second**: one clear gesture + one clear prop/setting.
- Use **one focal character** (often Peppa) and optionally **one supporting character** if it helps the phrase.
- Include **1–3 context objects** that teach the meaning (e.g., calendar, lunch dish, umbrella, toys).
- Keep the background **simple**: a soft sky/room gradient or a few big shapes (ground, wall, window).
- Leave **breathing room** around the characters; avoid clutter and tiny decorative patterns.

COLOR & MOOD
- Use a **bright, sunny palette** (pinks, light blues, greens, warm yellows).
- Prefer **flat colors**; use **only gentle gradients** when it adds softness (sky glow, lamp light).
- Avoid dark/muddy colors; if you need “stormy,” keep it **storybook-safe** (soft grays + warm indoor light).

CLARITY AT SMALL SIZE (educational usefulness)
- Keep silhouettes bold and readable; props should be **instantly recognizable**.
- If you add text (like “¡BIEN!”), make it **large and simple**; otherwise rely on visuals.

MAKE EACH IMAGE DISTINCT
- Even if multiple phrases share characters, vary **pose, props, setting, and camera angle** so each feels unique.

LIGHTWEIGHT SVG (gently, without overthinking it)
- Prefer simple shapes and grouped parts; avoid heavy filters or excessive tiny paths.
- Keep the illustration clean so it loads quickly and scales nicely.

CHARACTER COLORS (standard Peppa Pig palette):
--------------------------------------
- Peppa Pig: Red dress (#E63946), Pink head (#F9C6CF), Pink snout/nostrils (#FF69B4)
- George Pig: Blue shirt (#6B9BD2), Pink head (#F9C6CF), Pink snout/nostrils (#FF69B4)
- Mummy Pig: Orange body (#FF8A65), Lighter peach head (#FFAB91), Pink snout/nostrils (#FF69B4)
- Daddy Pig: Orange body (#FF8A65), Lighter peach head (#FFAB91), Pink snout/nostrils (#FF69B4)
- Suzy Sheep: White body (#FFFFFF), White head (#FFFFFF), Pink snout/nostrils (#FF69B4)
- Danny Dog: Orange/yellow body (#FFB74D), Orange/yellow head (#FFB74D), Pink snout/nostrils (#FF69B4)

IDEA #1: "The Neighborhood Question Scene"

DRAWING INSTRUCTIONS:
Create a charming bird's-eye view showing a colorful neighborhood with various 
types of homes arranged in a gentle curve. Place Peppa at a crossroads, looking 
upward with a curious expression, one trotter raised to her chin thoughtfully. 
Above her head, add a thought bubble containing three small icons: a house, an 
apartment building, and a farm. The background should feature a simplified 
map-like quality with winding paths connecting different homes. Each home should 
have distinct characteristics - one with a red roof and garden, another as a 
tall apartment block, and a third as a countryside cottage. Use soft pastel 
colors to create a welcoming atmosphere.

windows. Include distinctive details: a small garden with flowers, a chimney 
with gentle smoke curl, curtains in windows, and George's toy dinosaur peeking 
from one window. Add a mailbox with the Pig family name and a welcome mat.

an angle suggesting wind, leaves and twigs being blown about, and perhaps a 
bent umbrella tumbling past. A weather vane on a distant roof spins wildly. 
Inside, create warmth with Peppa and George pressed against the window, their 
breath creating small fog patches on glass. Behind them, show hot chocolate 
mugs, a cozy blanket, and soft lamp lighting. Daddy Pig visible in background

jumping rope or playing hopscotch. Include afternoon-specific details: empty 
lunch boxes on a picnic table, parents sitting on benches having coffee and 
chatting, longer shadows stretching across ground, and an ice cream vendor's 
cart in distance. Sky should be rich warm blue with golden quality light. 
Trees cast dappled shade where some children rest.

engaged in breakfast ritual: Mummy Pig pouring juice, Daddy Pig reading 
newspaper while eating, Peppa cheerfully eating cereal, and George with milk 
around his mouth. Include: morning sunlight streaming through window, wall 
clock showing 8:00 AM, calendar visible in background, radio on counter. Kitchen

These files share the same generic positive image. Each needs distinct 
illustration showing different levels of positivity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✓ DONE - FILE: 66_good.svg
PHRASE: ¡Bien! (Good!)
IDEA #41: "Peppa's Encouraging Nod"

DRAWING INSTRUCTIONS:
Show Peppa with a big smile, giving a single thumbs up with one trotter. Her 
head should be nodding slightly (add a small motion arc near her head). Her 
expression should be encouraging and positive. Add the word "¡BIEN!" in bold, 
colorful letters above her, or a large checkmark. The background is very 
simple - just a solid color or soft gradient. Use green and yellow colors to 
suggest "good" and "positive." Keep it clean and straightforward.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
✓ DONE - FILE: 72_everything_is_fine.svg
PHRASE: Todo está bien. (Everything is fine.)
IDEA #42: "Peppa's Reassuring Gesture"

DRAWING INSTRUCTIONS:
Draw Peppa with both trotters spread out to her sides in a calming, "everything's 
okay" gesture. She should have a peaceful, reassuring smile. Add a small sun 
icon and maybe a rainbow in the background to suggest everything is good. Her 
posture should be relaxed and open. Maybe add a few small hearts or stars 
around her. Use soft, calming colors - pastels and light blues. Keep the 
composition balanced and peaceful.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILE: 76_very_well_done.svg
PHRASE: ¡Muy bien hecho! (Very well done!)
IDEA #43: "Madame Gazelle Clapping"

DRAWING INSTRUCTIONS:
Show Madame Gazelle (the teacher) clapping her hands together with a proud, 
beaming smile. Add sparkles or stars around her hands to emphasize the clapping. 
Her expression should be warm and encouraging. Maybe add a gold star icon 
floating near her. The background should be simple - perhaps suggesting a 
classroom with just a hint of a board or wall. Use warm, encouraging colors - 
golds, yellows, and warm oranges. Keep focus on the teacher's proud expression.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILE: 92_i_am_well_thank_you.svg
PHRASE: Estoy bien, gracias. (I am well, thank you.)
IDEA #33: "Peppa's Thumbs Up Response"

DRAWING INSTRUCTIONS:
Show Peppa standing with one trotter giving a thumbs up, and a content smile 
on her face. Her other trotter should be relaxed at her side. Add a small 
smiley face icon or heart near her to reinforce the "bien" (well/good). Her 
posture should be upright and confident. The background is simple - just a 
plain color or soft gradient. Use cheerful colors - bright blues and pinks. 
Keep the composition clean and straightforward.

================================================================================
EXACT DUPLICATE GROUP 3: "Love It" Set (2 files)
================================================================================

These files share the same enthusiastic love image. Each needs distinct 
illustration showing different expressions of love/enthusiasm.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILE: 68_i_love_it.svg
PHRASE: ¡Me encanta! (I love it!)
IDEA #44: "Peppa with Big Heart"

DRAWING INSTRUCTIONS:
Draw Peppa hugging herself with both trotters crossed over her chest, eyes 
closed in pure joy. Add a large red or pink heart above her head, and several 
smaller hearts floating around her. Her expression should be blissful with a 
huge smile. Maybe add rosy cheeks and a slight glow around her. The background 
is simple - soft pink or purple gradient. Use lots of reds, pinks, and warm 
colors to convey love and enthusiasm. Keep the composition centered on Peppa.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FILE: 78_yes_id_love_to.svg
PHRASE: Sí, me encantaría. (Yes, I'd love to.)
IDEA #45: "Peppa's Enthusiastic Yes"

DRAWING INSTRUCTIONS:
Show Peppa nodding enthusiastically with both trotters raised in excitement. 
Her mouth should be open in a big "YES!" expression. Add motion lines around 
her head showing nodding. Include a few hearts floating around her and maybe 
some sparkles. Her whole body should show enthusiasm - maybe she's even 
bouncing slightly (add motion lines under feet). The background is simple - 
just a gradient or plain color. Use bright, energetic colors - pinks, reds, 
and yellows.
