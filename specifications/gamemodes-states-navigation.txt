# Game Modes Navigation

## Navbar Behavior
Navbar automatically hides on mobile in game modes, shows on desktop always.
Game mode paths in Navbar.svelte control this: /sanapeli, /yhdistasanat, /tarinat, /muisti, /kuuntelu, /lukeminen, /puhuminen, /pipsan-ystavat, /pipsan-maailma, /valitut-sanat

## Components

Home & Report states: Use GameContainer with buttonMode="basic" and back button
Playing/Question states: Use GameContainer + GameHeader (shows score, counter, quit button ✕)
Teaching states: Use BackButton between phases

GameContainer: wraps entire game mode layout
GameHeader: compact header with counter | score | tries | quit button
BackButton: navigation between teaching phases (arrow + text)

## Game State: Playing/Question Phase
During active quiz/matching (yhdistasanat example):
- GameContainer with showBackButton={false} (hides standard back button)
- GameHeader appears instead: shows counter | score | tries | X close button (top right)
- No phase indicators needed - user sees one question at a time
