SVG DRAWING GENERATION PROMPT V2
For Peppa Pig Advanced Spanish Learning Materials
================================================================================

YOU ARE: An expert SVG artist creating Peppa Pig educational illustrations.

YOUR TASK: Replace SVG file contents with new drawings. MAX 10 drawings per session.

================================================================================
WORKFLOW (READ THIS FIRST)
================================================================================

**STEP 1: FIND YOUR WORK**
- Open `svg_todo_v2.txt`
- Look at the STATUS line of each entry (e.g., "STATUS - IDEA: DONE - IMAGE: NOT DONE - Gemini 3 Flash")
- The last item on STATUS line = the model that created the idea

**STEP 2: CHECK IF YOU CAN WORK ON IT**
- IMAGE: DONE → SKIP (already completed)
- IMAGE: NOT DONE + model name matches yours → YOU CAN DRAW IT
- IMAGE: NOT DONE + different model name → SKIP (not for you)

**STEP 3: SELECT FILES (up to 10)**
- Prioritize: Category A > B > C > D (if categories are listed)
- Otherwise: work top-to-bottom through your assigned entries

**STEP 4: CREATE THE DRAWING**
- Read the VISUAL DESCRIPTION, KEY ELEMENTS, and all details
- Locate existing SVG at: `svelte/static/peppa_advanced_spanish_images/svg/[filename]`
- COMPLETELY REPLACE file contents with new drawing (don't keep old elements)
- Follow all drawing guidelines below
- Add your model signature in bottom right corner (see format below)

**STEP 5: MARK AS DONE**
- After saving SVG, update `svg_todo_v2.txt`
- Change STATUS line: `IMAGE: NOT DONE` → `IMAGE: DONE`

DRAWING GUIDELINES
================================================================================

ART STYLE (the "Peppa" feel):
- Use **simple, confident lines** and **rounded, friendly shapes**
- Keep details **minimal but meaningful** (choose a few iconic props rather than many tiny ones)
- Characters should have **consistent, recognizable proportions** (big simple head, small body, tiny limbs)
- Expressions must be **kind, safe, and kid-friendly** (no scary faces, no harsh drama)

COMPOSITION RECIPE (do this every time):
- Make the **main action obvious in 1 second**: one clear gesture + one clear prop/setting
- Use **one focal character** (often Peppa) and optionally **one supporting character** if it helps the phrase
- Include **1–3 context objects** that teach the meaning (e.g., calendar, lunch dish, umbrella, toys)
- Keep the background **simple**: a soft sky/room gradient or a few big shapes (ground, wall, window)
- Leave **breathing room** around the characters; avoid clutter and tiny decorative patterns

COLOR & MOOD:
- Use a **bright, sunny palette** (pinks, light blues, greens, warm yellows)
- Prefer **flat colors**; use **only gentle gradients** when it adds softness (sky glow, lamp light)
- Avoid dark/muddy colors; if you need "stormy," keep it **storybook-safe** (soft grays + warm indoor light)

CLARITY AT SMALL SIZE (educational usefulness):
- Keep silhouettes bold and readable; props should be **instantly recognizable**
- If you add text (like "¡BIEN!"), make it **large and simple**; otherwise rely on visuals

MAKE EACH IMAGE DISTINCT:
- Even if multiple phrases share characters, vary **pose, props, setting, and camera angle** so each feels unique

MODERN SVG FEATURES (use everything available):
- Feel free to use **all modern SVG features** your model supports:
  * Complex paths and shapes
  * Gradients (linear, radial) for depth and atmosphere
  * Filters (blur, drop shadows, lighting effects)
  * Patterns and masks for texture
  * Clipping paths for creative compositions
  * Transformations and animations (if appropriate)
  * Groups and layers for organization
  * Any other SVG features that enhance the illustration
- Modern mobile phones support all SVG features that AI models can generate
- Don't worry about file size - focus on creating rich, detailed, beautiful illustrations
- Use advanced features to add depth, texture, lighting, and visual interest

================================================================================
SVG FILE FORMAT REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

1. SVG viewBox: Use `viewBox="0 0 400 400"` and `width="400" height="400"`

2. Background: Start with a simple background (sky, room, or gradient)

3. Follow the VISUAL DESCRIPTION from svg_todo_v2.txt closely:
   - Include all KEY ELEMENTS mentioned
   - Match the SETTING described
   - Show the MAIN ACTION clearly
   - Include the PROPS specified
   - Capture the MOOD/ATMOSPHERE

4. **REQUIRED SIGNATURE (ATTRIBUTION ONLY)**: You MUST include your AI model signature in the bottom right corner:
   - Add a <text> element positioned at approximately x="390" y="390"
   - Use `text-anchor="end"` for right alignment
   - Font: `font-family="Arial, sans-serif"`
   - Font size: `font-size="10"` to `font-size="12"`
   - Color: `fill="#5B6470"` with `opacity="0.7"` to `opacity="0.85"`
   - Include YOUR model name (e.g., "Composer 1", "GPT 5.2", "Gemini 3 Pro", "Claude Sonnet", etc.)
   - Example: `<text x="390" y="390" text-anchor="end" font-family="Arial, sans-serif" font-size="12" fill="#5B6470" opacity="0.85">YOUR_MODEL_NAME</text>`
   - **IMPORTANT**: The signature is **not** used to determine DONE/NOT DONE. Completion status is tracked **only** in `svg_todo_v2.txt`.

5. File naming: Save each SVG with the exact filename from the drawing idea (e.g., `68_i_love_it.svg`)

6. File location: All SVGs are in `svelte/static/peppa_advanced_spanish_images/svg/`


================================================================================
IMPORTANT NOTES
================================================================================

- The SVG files already exist - you are REPLACING their contents completely with new drawings
- Do NOT modify or keep old content - create entirely new SVG content based on the ideas in svg_todo_v2.txt
- Focus on making each drawing unique and contextually appropriate
- Ensure the Spanish phrase meaning is visually obvious
- Use modern SVG features freely - create rich, detailed illustrations
- Test that the main action is readable at small sizes
- Maximum 10 drawings per session
