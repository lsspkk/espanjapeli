Read ai-control/PRINCIPLES.md, and follow its guidelines
for example about venv and npm test scripts.
Read ai-control/codebase.md, to understand the project.

Be short when explaining your workflow to user: 
Analyzing. Writing. Done. 
Avoid shell commands that need permission, 
e.g. Edit/copy files through you own file system access.

Dont improvize and do extra stuff. 
If you are unsure or must choose between options, ask the user for clarification.
